## Suggested New Features
- Maybe we also want to add a false ring marker.
- Message and contact us Tab
- Sliding for the image (iframe tag)
- Scalebar (spend more time, begin, end and distance), choice between DPI or scalebar not both. record how we got it.
- We could also fit a spline (cubic, etc.) through the graph and make a second plot with detrended ring width index.
- residual from spline (output)
- detrended
- change to button saying 'Not confimred' until to click on it and it says 'confirmed'. Maybe with a disk icon? SHOULD BE AN ACTION BUTTON!
- new feature for a comment marker (ignore for distance calculation but record the year, always smaller no., h, double click to be merged with false ring)

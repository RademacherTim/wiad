## TRIAD Working Issues

This is a place to document known issues, reproducible bugs and new ideas. 

### Known Issues
This document lists the know issues identfied during the devlopement process.

- add option to measure scale bar in the image as pop-up dialogue, maybe?

- change to button saying 'Not confimred' until to click on it and it says 'confirmed'. Maybe with a disk icon?

- Once downloaded the download dialogue window stays open.

- Change to be perpendicular if the last marker was a linker.

- Something is wrong witht the calculation. The numbers currently do not add up, although the formula seems to make sense. Mabye the x and y coordinates are not registered correctly.

- Change the file name to make use of the metadata, this makes it easier for the user to process the data afterwards (i.e. automating the reading of several files generated by TRIAD).

- Shows pixels even when DPI is entered. We could also fit a spline through the graph and make a second plot with detrended ring width index.

- Linker gets NA
- flipped x and Y


### Suggested New Features
- Maybe we also want to add a false ring marker.
- Message and contact us Tab
- Sliding for the image
- Put image in a frame 
- Scalebar

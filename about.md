**TRIAD** is the Tree Ring Image Analysis and Dataset. 

### Application and Use
In order to extract visual data from wood, one needs to: 

1. Collect and prepare wood samples; 
2. Measure visual information such as annual ring or early wood width; and
3. Process the raw data (i.e. cross-dating and detrending).

All three steps require meticulous detail and expertise, thus are painstaking and time intenstive. As a consequence studies relying on properties of wood have been limited to small samples sizes (typically n < 100). Because all steps rely on the scientists subjective expertise and reporting in tehe scientific literature, at best, describes the used tools and methods, studies based on visual properties of wood lack complete transparency. As a consequence, reproducing a study based on visual properties of wood involves completely repeating the painstaking and time intensive steps. TRIAD's vision is to create a tool that allows traceable automation of these steps, which would have huge benefits for science using visual data from wood.

In its first version, the TRIAD toolbox provides an simple interactive web interface to facilitate the measurement of tree ring (or early- and latewood) widths from scanned images and save the results in the online repository. The tool is freely avaiable online and stores the images and data series for easy sharing with collaborators and the public access after quality control (an potentially requested embargo periods).

While images are accummulating in the TRIAD database, novel techniques to automate data extraction and cross-dating are continuously being developed by the TRIAD development community led by the TRIAD core development team. Features such as automatic tree ring detection and automatic cross-dating will be added to the free online tool as soon as they have been thoroughly tested.

### Objective and Mission

The objective of TRIAD is to serve as a repository for digital images of wood and derived data and to make that imagery and derived data products freely available to a wide array of third-party data end-users, including researchers, educators and the general public. Thus, contact details for specific datasets are made publicly available to enhance collaboration. The raw imagery is also made publicly available without restrictions for non-commerical uses (read specifics under the fair-use policy), but an embargo period of up to four years can be requested. We strongly recommend the download of imagery and datasets for use in your own research and teaching.

The mission of the TRIAD team is to advance dendroscience by providing a free tool and repository that will enable unforeseen analyses based on larger sample sizes, novel characteristics and new methods analysis, while equally facilitating data sharing and access. Finally, TRIAD provides the tools to make dendroscience even more transparent, reproducible, low cost and engaging.

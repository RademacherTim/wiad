**TRIAD** is the Tree Ring Image Analysis and Dataset. 

### Application and Use
In order to extract meaningful data from digital images of wood, one needs to: 

1. Collect and prepare the wood sample; 
2. Measure variables such as ring width; and
3. Cross-date the resulting time series.

However, these steps are painstaking, and lack transparency and reproducibility, if performed with a linear table, thus could hugely profit from traceable automation.

In its first version, the TRIAD toolbox provides an simple interactive web interface to facilitate the measurement of tree ring widths from scanned images and save the results in the online repository. The tool is freely avaiable online and stores the images and data series for easy sharing with collaborators and the public access after an embargo period of five years.

While images are accummulating in the TRIAD database, novel techniques to automate data extraction and cross-dating are continuously being developed by the TRIAD core development team. Features such as automatic tree ring detection and automatic cross-dating will be added to the free online tool as soon as they have been thoroughly tested.


### Objective and Mission

The objective of TRIAD is to serve as a repository for digital images of wood and derived data and to make that imagery and derived data products freely available to a wide array of third-party data end-users, including researchers, educators and the general public. Thus, contact details for specific datasets is made publicly available to enhance collaboration. The raw imagery is also made publicly available without restrictions, but an embargo period of up to four years can be requested. We recommend the download of imagery and datasets for use in your own research and teaching.

The mission of the TRIAD team is to advance tree-ring science by providing a free tool and repository that will enable unforeseen explorations and new methods analysis, while equally facilitating data sharing and access. TRIAD will provide the tools to make tree ring science transparent and reproducible.

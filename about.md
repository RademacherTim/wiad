**TRIAD** stands for Tree Ring Image Analysis and Dataset. 

### Application and Use

In order to extract visual data from images of ecological samples, such as wood, one needs to: 

1. Collect and prepare samples; 
2. Measure visual information such as annual ring or early wood width; and
3. Process the raw data (i.e. cross-dating and detrending).

All three steps require meticulous detail and expertise, thus are painstaking and time intenstive. As a consequence studies relying on visual properties have been limited to small samples sizes (typically n < 100). Because all steps rely on the scientists subjective expertise and reporting in the scientific literature limits itself to describing the used tools and methods instead of providing raw data, studies based on visual properties of wood and other ecological data lack transparency. As a consequence, reproducing a study based on visual properties wood require repeating all three painstaking and time intensive steps. TRIAD's vision is to create a platform that allows traceable automation of these steps and the saves the underlying raw data with huge benefits for data sharing.

In its first version, the TRIAD provides an simple interactive web interface to facilitate the measurement, evaluation and correction of distance measurements, such as tree rings (or early- and latewood) widths from scanned images. Resulting data and the images are saved in the online repository. The tool is freely available online and stores the images and data series for easy sharing with collaborators and public access after quality control.

Equally, TRIAD provides simple data processing tools. Currently, the tools allow online ploting of the data in real-time and extraction of ring width indices based on several common detrending methods.

While images are accummulating in the TRIAD database, novel techniques to automate data extraction and cross-dating are continuously being developed by the TRIAD development community led by the TRIAD core development team. Features such as automatic tree ring detection and automatic cross-dating will be added to the free online tool as soon as they have been thoroughly tested.

### Objective and Mission

The objective of TRIAD is to serve as a repository for digital images of ecological samples (i.e. increment cores, thinsections, x-ray films, root and leaf scans) and derived data. The overarching aim is to share the imagery and derived data products with a wide array of third-party data end-users, including researchers, educators and the general public. Thus, contact details for specific datasets are made publicly available to enhance collaboration and data sharing. The raw imagery is also made publicly available without restrictions for non-commerical uses (read specifics under the fair-use policy). We strongly recommend the download of imagery and datasets for use in your own research and teaching, but please acknowledge all the work that went into building this tool.

The mission of the TRIAD team is to advance eco-physiological sciences by providing a free tool and repository that will enable unforeseen analyses based on larger sample sizes, novel visual characteristics and new methods of analysis, while equally facilitating data sharing and access. Thereby, TRIAD intends to make eco-physiological sciences more transparent, reproducible, low cost and engaging.

### The TRIAD team

## Core team
TRIAD was the idea of Tim Rademacher, which was developed together with Bijan Seyednasrollah and David Basler. Bijan led the development of the TRIAD v0.1. 

## Extended collaborators 
Many people have contributed in the development and testing of the tools and software offered through TRIAD. In particular, we want to thank Tessa Mandra, Elise Miller, David Orwig, Neil Pederson, and Donglai Wei. 

### Acknowledgement
TRIAD depends on multiple collaborators, including contributors and users, which are thanked for their efforts in support of TRIAD.

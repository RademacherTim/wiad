- TTR: add option to measure scale bar in the image as pop-up dialogue, maybe?

- TTR: change to button saying 'Not confimred' until to click on it and it says 'confirmed'. Maybe with a disk icon?

- TTR: Once downloaded the download dialogue window stays open.

- TTR: Something is wrong witht the calculation. The numbers currently do not add up, although the formula seems to make sense. Mabye the x and y coordinates are not registered correctly.

- TTR Change the file name to make use of the metadata, this makes it easier for the user to process the data afterwards (i.e. automating the reading of several files generated by TRIAD).

- TTR Shows pixels even when DPI is entered. We could also fit a spline through the graph and make a second plot with detrended ring width index.

- BS Linker gets NA
- BS flipped x and Y
- 
### Suggested New Features

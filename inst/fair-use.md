### Acknowledgement Format

We request that all publications using WIAD to process data, downloaded imagery or derived data products properly cite WIAD as a software package and the paper describing the software (citations below). Furthermore, we request that papers acknowledge WIAD's core development team and all appropriate contributors for every WIAD datum used in your analysis. Finally, we also expect that data users contact the data contributors directly via the email address attached to each datum to collaborate. A lot of effort goes into collecting data and the contributors know their data best and will be able to help and improve your analysis.

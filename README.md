# WIAD: Wood Image Analysis and Dataset

The Wood Image Analysis and Dataset is a dynamic interface to extract, store and share data from images of tree rings, such as annual ring width. 

WIAD presents a dynamic interface for a wide range of scientists in archeology, ecology, geology, climatology and chronology disciplines to digitise and analyze their tree ring imagery easily, back up results and share them with collaborators and the public.

We request that all publications using TRIAD to process data or downloaded imagery or derived data products properly cite TRIAD as a software package and the paper describing the software (citations below). Furthermore, we request that papers acknowledge TRIAD's core development team and all appropriate contributors for every TRIAD datum used in your analysis. Furthermore, we do expect that data users contact the data contributors directly via the email address attached to each datum to collaborate. A lot of effort goes into collecting data and the contributors know their data best and will be able to help and improve your analysis.

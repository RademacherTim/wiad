### Mission

The objective of TRIAD is to serve as a repository for digital images of wood and derived data and to make that imagery and derived data products freely available to a wide array of third-party data end-users, including researchers, educators and the general public. Thus, contact details for specific datasets is made publicly available to enhance collaboration. The raw imagery is also made publicly available without restrictions, but an embargo period of up to four years can be requested. We recommend the download of imagery and datasets for use in your own research and teaching.


### Acknowledgement Format

We request that all publications using TRIAD to process data or downloaded imagery or derived data products properly cite TRIAD. Furthermore, we request that the paper acknowledge the TRIAD and contributors to TRIAD and the appropriate contributors for every TRIAD datum used in your analysis. The text for these acknowledgements is included in each json file when downloaded.


### Distribution and Re-Use Policy

The publicly-accessible imagery and derived data is freely available under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.
